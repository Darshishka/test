  <h2 style="color: #C00">Celebrate 100 years of Collage </h2>
    <p>2012 is the centenary year of collage as fine art. A collage (from the French word; coller, to glue) is a work of formal art made from an assemblage of different pieces, thus creating a new whole. The term collage was coined by both Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of modern art.</p>
    <h2>The Northwest Collage Society </h2>
    <p>The Northwest Collage Society held its first regional meeting in 1984 as the North Coast Collage Society. In 1997 it became the Northwest Collage Society. The NWCS is affiliated with the <a href="http://nationalcollage.com" title="National Collage Society" target="_blank"><strong>National Collage Society, Inc.</strong></a>, a non-profit organization headquartered in Hudson, OH with Gail Larson, NCS as regional representative. The purpose of NWCS, as adopted from the National Collage Society’s Articles of Incorporation, is “to foster the appreciation and interest in the recognized medium of collage.” The NWCS works to advance the stature of collage as a major art medium and assist in the education of its members and the public through exhibits, workshops, lectures and publications.</p>
    <h2>Meetings and membership benefits</h2>
    <p>The Northwest Collage Society meets in Seattle at the <a href="http://shorelinearts.net" title="Shoreline Community Center" target="_blank"><strong>Shoreline Community Center</strong></a>, 18650 1st Ave NE, four to five times a year, September through June. Meetings offer a variety of programs including guest speakers, demonstrations and slide presentations. Dues are payable the first of September, annually. The organization draws most of its members from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and British Columbia. They come from diverse backgrounds: painting, printmaking, graphics, glass, sculpture, fiber and mixed media; all share an avid interest in creating.<br />
      <br />
      Members are kept informed through a bimonthly <strong><a href="../newsltr.htm" title="Newsletter">newsletter</a></strong> that includes information on workshops, opportunities to enter juried shows, details of upcoming programs and recognition of members’ accomplishments.</p>
    <h2>Exhibitions</h2>
    <p> The Northwest Collage Society arranges two or more juried exhibitions a year for its members. Juried exhibitions are held primarily in the greater Seattle area as well as throughout the state of Washington. The Northwest Collage Society hosted an Open-Juried Exhibit at the Washington State Convention Center in 2004. We’ve also exhibited at ArtsWest Gallery in West Seattle, Arts Council of Snohomish County at the Monte Cristo Hotel in Everett, Mercer Island Community Center Gallery, ArtsNow in Edmonds, Cancer Lifeline in Seattle, Sequim Museum &amp; Arts Center, Parklane Gallery in Kirkland and many more.<br />
      <br />
      Local members may also join the <a href="http://nationalcollage.com" title="National Collage Society" target="_blank"><strong>National Collage Society</strong></a>, which entitles them to an entry into the National Show and a Postcard entry in the annual National Postcard Show. Signature membership in the National Collage Society is attained after acceptance in three of the national exhibitions and is indicated by the initials NCS after the member’s name.
